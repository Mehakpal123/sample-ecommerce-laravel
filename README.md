## ecommerce-laravel

ecommerce is a platform that provides ease to the sellers and customers to connect without any physical interaction and they can sale and purchase products on a platform.

## Tech stack

We used Laravel framework, MySQL, React JS for front-end and used Inertia JS(Modern Monolith) to connect back-end and front-end in a single code base without creating APIs.
