## ecommerce-laravel

ecommerce is a straightforward web application that enables customers to purchase items without any physical interaction and can pay online with delivery tracking.

## Tech stack

We used Laravel framework, MySQL, React JS for front-end and used Inertia JS(Modern Monolith) to connect back-end and front-end in a single code base without creating APIs.

# Concept

## React with Inertia

- `Inertia JS` allow us to use React in Laravel framework without creating APIs.
- Automatically renders React server-side and client-side.
- In React used `JSX`, `ES6`.


## Styled-Component
- Styled-components lets you write actual `CSS` in your `JavaScript`. This means you can use all the features of `CSS` you use including (but by far not limited to) media queries, all pseudo-selectors, nesting, etc.


## Association

- **has_many Association** :

  A `has_many` association indicates a one-to-many connection with another model. This association indicates that   each instance of the model has zero or more instances of another model.
  
- **belongs_to Association** :

  A `belongs_to` association sets up a connection with another model, such that each instance of the declaring model "belongs to" one instance of the other model.
